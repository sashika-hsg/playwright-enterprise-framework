QA Automation Framework (Playwright + TypeScript) — Enterprise-Style
An enterprise-grade automation framework built to demonstrate Senior Test Analyst / QA Automation Engineer capabilities: maintainable test architecture, scalable patterns, CI-ready execution, and reliable UI + API validation.

This project is intentionally designed as a portfolio-grade framework to reflect how automation is built and maintained in large-scale enterprise and FAANG-style environments.

Tech Stack: Playwright • TypeScript • Node.js • GitHub Actions • HTML Reports • [Allure (optional)]
Target AUT: Practice Software Testing (public demo site)

What this repo demonstrates
Layered automation architecture beyond basic POM (Pages, Business Flows, Core Utilities, Data Builders)
Stable execution practices (retries, traces, screenshots, video on failure)
Suite strategy aligned to real delivery teams (Smoke vs Regression)
CI/CD readiness with GitHub Actions (PR validation, artifact retention, failure diagnostics)
A framework structured to scale across enterprise applications and multiple teams
